# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

## Overview

This project develops a model that accurately recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The aim is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Food-101 dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101).

The Food-101 dataset includes images of 101 different food categories, making it suitable for training a model to recognize various types of food.

## Files

- `app.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the food recognition and calorie estimation model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Food-101 dataset (please download and place the dataset here).

## Usage

1. Download the Food-101 dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Install the required packages using the command:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

3. Run the `app.py` script:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
